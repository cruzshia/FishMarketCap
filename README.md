# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm cypress:open`

Runs the cypress tools.\
Please run npm start first so cypress can test app in local server.

### `npm lint`

Runs the eslint check.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: Exchange list RWD page doesn't support IE 11, because rc-table uses position: sticky style**

If we wan't support IE 11, I'll suggest use some polyfills (e.g. StickyBits) to make it display correctly.
